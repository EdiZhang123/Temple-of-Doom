# Temple-of-Doom

This is a single player game in which you must kill various monsters and pass through five levels to retrieve the golden idol.

You can pick up items (scrolls, weapons) and store them in your inventory. Smart monsters (Goblin) will always approach you in the shortest path. Dumb monsters (Bogeyman, Snakewoman) won't be able to go ground corridors/walls to reach you, even if they are in range.

The rooms and layout are randomly generated at runtime, as well as the monsters. Your inventory can store a max of 26 items

Use the arrows to move, attack a monster by moving into it.
